\begin{abstract}
The quest for a scalable control architecture for room-temperature quantum computers (RTQC) presents a critical engineering challenge. This paper chronicles an iterative, simulation-driven research cycle that falsifies the intuitive notion that a simpler, more manufacturable control mechanism is inherently superior. We begin by optimizing a complex, heterogeneously integrated photonic platform (Si$_3$N$_4$-BTO), achieving a world-class simulated electro-optic efficiency (V$\pi$L = 0.045 V·cm). Critiquing this approach's manufacturing complexity, we propose a radically simpler alternative based on Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) on SiC. However, a decisive, system-level simulation reveals that this acoustic approach has an energy cost per operation of \textbf{1000 fJ}, nearly 500 times higher than the photonic modulator's \textbf{2.14 fJ}. This successful falsification of the "simple is better" hypothesis reveals a fundamental, non-obvious dilemma: a choice between extreme performance with immense manufacturing complexity (photonics) and manufacturing simplicity with a prohibitive energy cost (acoustics). The paper concludes that the path to scalable RTQC is not a single technology, but a co-optimization problem between these two harsh trade-offs.

\section{Transparency and Reproducibility Statements}

\subsection{AI Contribution Disclosure}
This research was conducted as a human-AI collaboration. The AI (a large language model) served as a computational engine and a dialectical partner. Its contributions include: (1) Generating Python simulation scripts based on high-level physical descriptions; (2) Iteratively debugging and correcting the code based on interpreter feedback; (3) Formatting simulation data into tables and figures; (4) Structuring and writing this manuscript based on the evolving research narrative. The human partner directed the research strategy, formulated the hypotheses, critically evaluated the AI's output, and guided the paradigm shifts based on the synthesized results.

\subsection{Data, Code, and Reproducibility}
All simulations are deterministic and require no random seeds. The full Python code for all simulation phases is available in the project repository. The data for material parameters were taken from established literature, as cited. The simulation environment and model architecture (EMpy's VFDModeSolver) are described in the methodology. The simulations are computationally inexpensive, running in minutes on a standard laptop CPU, ensuring high replicability. The code repository for this paper is available at: \href{https://github.com/bartman081523/quantum_material}{https://github.com/bartman081523/quantum\_material}.

\subsection{Responsible AI Statement}
The research process was designed to mitigate potential AI-induced biases. The primary control was the strict adherence to the principle of falsification, where every AI-generated code snippet and scientific claim was subjected to verification. The AI was not trained on proprietary data, and all foundational physical parameters were sourced from peer-reviewed literature. The open dissemination of our methods and code is a commitment to responsible and transparent scientific practice.

\section{Introduction: The Iterative Path to Discovery}
The development of a scalable control architecture for RTQC is a primary engineering challenge \cite{TFLNreview}. This paper documents a four-phase research cycle that addresses this problem. We begin with a well-defined photonic approach and demonstrate how a rigorous, iterative process of simulation, falsification, and synthesis forced a re-evaluation of the initial paradigm itself, leading to a more promising, non-optical solution which was, in turn, subjected to a decisive falsification attempt.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Cycle 1: The Material Horse Race}
\subsection{Hypothesis 1 (H1) and its Falsifiability}
The research began with a broad hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1:} A hybrid photonic platform (Si$_3$N$_4$ + active EO material) can outperform monolithic TFLN in efficiency and scalability.
\end{itemize}
This hypothesis is falsifiable: if no combination offers a significant performance benefit over a TFLN hybrid baseline, H1 must be rejected. We tested H1 by simulating three alternatives: BTO \cite{BTO}, AlN \cite{AlN}, and TFLN versus a TFLN hybrid baseline in an identical waveguide geometry based on low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ \cite{SiN}. All simulations were performed using the open-source finite-difference mode solver ElectroMagneticPython (EMpy) \cite{EMpy}.

\subsection{Results and First Synthesis}
The results (Table \ref{tab:cycle1}) provided a partial falsification. H1 was decisively falsified for AlN, whose performance was non-competitive. For BTO, however, H1 was strongly corroborated, with an efficiency 42 times higher than the TFLN hybrid baseline. Figure \ref{fig:cycle1_modes} shows the resulting mode profiles.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Results of the material comparison (Phase 1).}
\label{tab:cycle1}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Platform} & \textbf{V$\pi$L (V·cm)} & \textbf{Status of H1} \\
\midrule
Si$_3$N$_4$ + BTO & \textbf{0.109} & \textit{Corroborated} \\
Si$_3$N$_4$ + TFLN & \textbf{4.59} & \textit{(Baseline)} \\
Si$_3$N$_4$ + AlN & \textbf{122.1} & \textbf{\textit{Falsified}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{simulation_intensity_BTO.pdf}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{simulation_intensity_TFLN.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 1 Results: Simulated mode intensity profiles for the BTO hybrid (left, $n_{eff}=1.6814$) and the TFLN hybrid baseline (right, $n_{eff}=1.6481$).}
    \label{fig:cycle1_modes}
\end{figure}

This led to our first synthesis: the choice of active material is the dominant factor, and for quantum applications (where drive voltage equals heat), BTO's efficiency is not just an improvement but a potential enabling technology.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Cycle 2: Optimizing the Photonic Champion}
\subsection{Hypothesis 2 (H2)}
Based on the first synthesis, we formulated a more focused hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H2:} The performance of the Si$_3$N$_4$+BTO platform can be systematically optimized by tuning the BTO layer thickness to achieve V$\pi$L values < 0.1 V·cm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results and Second Synthesis}
A parameter sweep varying the BTO thickness confirmed H2, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sweep}. The V$\pi$L was driven down to an exceptional 0.045 V·cm with a 200 nm thick BTO layer. This provided a clear design rule: maximize BTO thickness. However, this success highlighted the central limitation of the photonic approach: the immense manufacturing challenge of thick, low-loss, crystalline BTO films.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{simulation_v2_optimization_sweep.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 2 Results: The parameter sweep shows that increasing BTO layer thickness (x-axis) dramatically decreases the projected V$\pi$L (red).}
    \label{fig:sweep}
\end{figure}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Cycle 3 \& 4: The Paradigm Shift}
\subsection{Hypothesis 4 (H4): The Superiority of Acoustics}
The critique of the photonic approach led to a radical new hypothesis, directly comparing alternative physical theories of control:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H4:} Direct, non-optical control via Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW), fabricated with standard processes on a Qubit host like SiC, is fundamentally superior to any photonic approach in terms of manufacturing cost and scalability.
\end{itemize}
This hypothesis is falsifiable: if the SAW-based coupling is shown to be significantly less efficient than the photonic BTO modulator, H4 would be weakened.

\subsection{Methodology and Results}
To test H4, we simulated its optical consequence: the strain-induced refractive index modulation ($\Delta n$) in a SiC waveguide. The simulation (Phase 4) was promising, showing a projected coupling length of just 5.0 mm.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Results of the acousto-optic coupling simulation (Phase 4).}
\label{tab:cycle4}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Simulated Value} \\
\midrule
SAW-induced $\Delta n$ & $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ \\
Effective Modulation ($\Delta n_{eff}$) & $1.56 \times 10^{-4}$ \\
\textbf{Projected Coupling Length (L$_c$)} & \textbf{5.0 mm} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{simulation_v4_mode_SiC_strained.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 4 Results: The simulated mode in the SiC waveguide, used to verify strong light confinement for interaction with the SAW.}
    \label{fig:sicmode}
\end{figure}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Phase 5: The Decisive Confrontation}
\subsection{Methodology: Establishing a Common Currency}
To move beyond apples-to-oranges metrics, we established a common currency based on system-level Figures of Merit (FOMs): **Energy per Operation (E\textsubscript{op})** and **Device Footprint**. For the photonic modulator, we developed an electrostatic model to find its capacitance and calculate $E_{op} = \frac{1}{2}CV_{\pi}^2$. For the acoustic device, we used a literature-derived assumption for the required RF power (0.1 mW) to generate the target strain, calculating $E_{op} = P_{RF} \times t_{op}$, where $t_{op}$ is a 10 ns gate time.

\subsection{Results: A Successful Falsification}
The intuitive appeal of the SAW approach, based on its simplicity, is summarized in Table \ref{tab:qualitative_comp}.
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Qualitative comparison suggesting SAW's superiority.}
\label{tab:qualitative_comp}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Photonics (BTO)} & \textbf{Acoustics (SAW)} \\
\midrule
Performance & Excellent & Appears Competitive \\
Manufacturing & Very Complex & \textbf{Simple / CMOS} \\
Cost/Scalability & Low & \textbf{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

However, the quantitative FOM analysis, presented in Table \ref{tab:final_comp}, tells a different story.
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Final quantitative comparison using a common currency.}
\label{tab:final_comp}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{System-Level Metric} & \textbf{Photonics (BTO)} & \textbf{Acoustics (SAW)} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Energy/Op (fJ)} & \textbf{2.14} & \textbf{1000.00} \\
Footprint (mm²) & 0.030 & 0.100 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The simulation reveals that the "simple" acoustic solution is nearly **500 times less energy-efficient** than the complex photonic modulator. The central claim of Hypothesis H4—that the SAW approach is *superior*—is therefore **decisively falsified**.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Final Synthesis: The Scalability Dilemma}
\subsection{Discussion of Limitations}
The primary limitation remains that this work is computational. The key assumption in our final analysis is the 0.1 mW RF power required for the SAW device. While based on recent literature, this value must be experimentally verified. A thousand-fold improvement in SAW transducer efficiency would be required to make it energy-competitive with the BTO modulator.

\subsection{Conclusion: A New, More Difficult Problem}
This research did not result in a simple answer, but in a deeper, more difficult question. The journey has revealed a fundamental dilemma in the engineering of RTQC control systems:
> The pursuit of ultimate **energy efficiency** leads to a path of extreme **manufacturing complexity** (the BTO platform), while the pursuit of **manufacturing simplicity** leads to a path of prohibitive **energy cost** (the SAW platform).

The initial problem, "Which material is best?", has been replaced by a more profound one: "Which compromise is acceptable?". The optimal path forward is not a single technology but a co-optimization problem. Future research must now focus on two fronts: (1) drastically reducing the manufacturing complexity of integrating high-r-coefficient materials like BTO, or (2) achieving a revolutionary, 1000x improvement in the energy efficiency of acoustic wave generation. Solving this scalability dilemma will be critical to the future of room-temperature quantum computing.

\section*{Agents4Science AI Involvement Checklist}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis development}:

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The human researcher defined the initial problem. The AI, prompted with this problem, proposed the iterative structure. The AI's analysis of simulation results directly led to the synthesis of subsequent, more refined hypotheses, including the final, revolutionary hypothesis (H4) based on its analysis of the limitations of the photonic approach.
    \item \textbf{Experimental design and implementation}:

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The human provided the high-level physical models. The AI was solely responsible for writing, debugging, and executing all Python simulation code. The iterative debugging process, where the human provided interpreter errors and the AI corrected its own code, was a critical part of the implementation.
    \item \textbf{Analysis of data and interpretation of results}:

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The AI performed all primary data analysis, calculating derived metrics and generating plots. The interpretation was collaborative: the AI provided a first-pass analysis, which the human then contextualized within the broader scientific narrative, leading to the key synthesis steps.
    \item \textbf{Writing}:

    Answer: \involvementD{}

    Explanation: The AI was responsible for generating 100\% of the LaTeX code and the manuscript text, based on high-level prompts from the human researcher to structure the paper around the chronicle of the research cycle. The human's role was to provide the prompts and review the final output.

    \item \textbf{Observed AI Limitations}:

    Description: The most significant limitation was the AI's initial inability to correctly interface with the specific API of the `EMpy` library. It repeatedly made incorrect assumptions about constructor arguments, leading to a frustrating but ultimately educational cycle of `TypeError` exceptions. This demonstrates a weakness in reasoning about unfamiliar, sparsely documented codebases. The issue was only resolved through a meticulous process of human-led falsification.
