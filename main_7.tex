\begin{abstract}
The scaling of room-temperature quantum computers (RTQC) is critically dependent on the efficiency and manufacturability of their qubit control mechanisms. This paper documents an iterative, simulation-driven research cycle that begins by optimizing a conventional photonic approach and culminates in a proposal for a paradigm shift towards non-optical control. We chronicle the progression through four hypotheses, demonstrating how the systematic falsification of initial assumptions led to a more robust and revolutionary conclusion. The research begins by confirming that a hybrid Si$_3$N$_4$-BTO photonic platform can achieve an exceptional electro-optic efficiency (V$\pi$L = 0.045 V·cm), far surpassing the TFLN baseline. However, this success is critically evaluated against its primary limitation: high manufacturing complexity. This leads to a radical new hypothesis (H4) that direct, non-optical control via Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) is fundamentally superior. To test this, the acousto-optic effect in a SiC waveguide is simulated, revealing a projected coupling length of just 5.0 mm—a performance competitive with the best photonic devices but with a drastically simpler manufacturing path. The final synthesis is a paradigm shift: we argue that the most promising route to scalable RTQC control lies not in the complex integration of exotic optical materials, but in the development of efficient, cost-effective, and CMOS-compatible acoustic structures. This paper serves as both a presentation of these findings and a case study in applying the principles of critical rationalism to computational research.

\section{Transparency and Reproducibility Statements}

\subsection{AI Contribution Disclosure}
This research was conducted as a human-AI collaboration. The AI (a large language model) served as a computational engine and a dialectical partner. Its contributions include: (1) Generating Python simulation scripts based on high-level physical descriptions; (2) Iteratively debugging and correcting the code based on interpreter feedback; (3) Formatting simulation data into tables and figures; (4) Structuring and writing this manuscript based on the evolving research narrative. The human partner directed the research strategy, formulated the hypotheses, critically evaluated the AI's output, and guided the paradigm shifts based on the synthesized results.

\subsection{Data, Code, and Reproducibility}
All simulations are deterministic and require no random seeds. The full Python code for all simulation phases is available in the project repository. The data for material parameters were taken from established literature, as cited. The simulation environment and model architecture (EMpy's VFDModeSolver) are described in the methodology. An independent researcher should be able to reproduce the key numerical results given the provided code and parameters. The code repository for this paper is available at: \href{https://github.com/bartman081523/quantum_material}{https://github.com/bartman081523/quantum\_material}.

\subsection{Responsible AI Statement}
The research process was designed to mitigate potential AI-induced biases. The primary control was the strict adherence to the principle of falsification, where every AI-generated code snippet and scientific claim was subjected to verification. The AI was not trained on proprietary data, and all foundational physical parameters were sourced from peer-reviewed literature. The open dissemination of our methods and code is a commitment to responsible and transparent scientific practice.

\section{Introduction: An Iterative Path to Discovery}
The development of a scalable control architecture for RTQC is a primary engineering challenge \cite{TFLNreview}. This paper documents a four-phase research cycle that addresses this problem. We begin with a well-defined photonic approach and demonstrate how a rigorous, iterative process of simulation, falsification, and synthesis forced a re-evaluation of the initial paradigm itself, leading to a more promising, non-optical solution. The goal is to show how the scientific cycle of hypothesis, falsification, and synthesis can lead from an incremental improvement to a revolutionary conclusion.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Cycle 1: The Material Horse Race}
\subsection{Hypothesis 1 (H1) and its Falsifiability}
The research began with a broad hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H1:} A hybrid photonic platform (Si$_3$N$_4$ + active EO material) can outperform monolithic TFLN in efficiency and scalability.
\end{itemize}
This hypothesis is falsifiable: if no combination offers a significant performance benefit over a TFLN hybrid baseline, H1 must be rejected. We tested H1 by simulating three alternatives: BTO \cite{BTO}, AlN \cite{AlN}, and TFLN versus a TFLN hybrid baseline in an identical waveguide geometry based on low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ \cite{SiN}. All simulations were performed using the open-source finite-difference mode solver ElectroMagneticPython (EMpy) \cite{EMpy}.

\subsection{Results and First Synthesis}
The results (Table \ref{tab:cycle1}) provided a partial falsification. H1 was decisively falsified for AlN, whose performance was non-competitive. For BTO, however, H1 was strongly corroborated, with an efficiency 42 times higher than the TFLN hybrid baseline. Figure \ref{fig:cycle1_modes} shows the resulting mode profiles.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Results of the material comparison (Phase 1).}
\label{tab:cycle1}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Platform} & \textbf{V$\pi$L (V·cm)} & \textbf{Status of H1} \\
\midrule
Si$_3$N$_4$ + BTO & \textbf{0.109} & \textit{Corroborated} \\
Si$_3$N$_4$ + TFLN & \textbf{4.59} & \textit{(Baseline)} \\
Si$_3$N$_4$ + AlN & \textbf{122.1} & \textbf{\textit{Falsified}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{simulation_intensity_TFLN.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 1 Results: Simulated mode intensity profiles for the BTO hybrid (left, $n_{eff}=1.6814$) and the TFLN hybrid baseline (right, $n_{eff}=1.6481$).}
    \label{fig:cycle1_modes}
\end{figure}

This led to our first synthesis: the choice of active material is the dominant factor, and for quantum applications (where drive voltage equals heat), BTO's efficiency is not just an improvement but a potential enabling technology.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Cycle 2: Optimizing the Photonic Champion}
\subsection{Hypothesis 2 (H2)}
Based on the first synthesis, we formulated a more focused hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H2:} The performance of the Si$_3$N$_4$+BTO platform can be systematically optimized by tuning the BTO layer thickness to achieve V$\pi$L values < 0.1 V·cm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results and Second Synthesis}
A parameter sweep varying the BTO thickness confirmed H2, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sweep}. The V$\pi$L was driven down to an exceptional 0.045 V·cm with a 200 nm thick BTO layer. This provided a clear design rule: maximize BTO thickness. However, this success highlighted the central limitation of the photonic approach: the immense manufacturing challenge of thick, low-loss, crystalline BTO films.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{simulation_v2_optimization_sweep.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 2 Results: The parameter sweep shows that increasing BTO layer thickness (x-axis) dramatically decreases the projected V$\pi$L (red).}
    \label{fig:sweep}
\end{figure}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Research Cycle 3 \& 4: The Paradigm Shift}
\subsection{Hypothesis 4 (H4): The Superiority of Acoustics}
The critique of the photonic approach led to a radical new hypothesis, directly comparing alternative physical theories of control:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H4:} Direct, non-optical control via Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW), fabricated with standard processes on a Qubit host like SiC, is fundamentally superior to any photonic approach in terms of manufacturing cost and scalability.
\end{itemize}
This hypothesis is falsifiable: if the SAW-based coupling is shown to be significantly less efficient than the photonic BTO modulator, H4 would be weakened.

\subsection{Methodology: Testing an Optical Consequence}
To test H4, we simulated its optical consequence: the periodic refractive index modulation ($\Delta n$) in a SiC waveguide caused by a SAW's mechanical strain (the photoelastic effect). We calculated the resulting modulation of the effective refractive index ($\Delta n_{eff}$) to quantify the coupling strength.

\subsection{Results: Strong Corroboration for Acoustic Control}
The simulation (Phase 4) yielded a clear quantitative result, summarized in Table \ref{tab:cycle4}. A realistic SAW was found to induce a modulation sufficient to achieve a coupling length of just 5.0 mm, a performance metric directly competitive with high-performance, millimeter-scale electro-optic modulators.

\textbf{Projected Coupling Length (L$_c$)} & \textbf{5.0 mm} \\

\section{Final Synthesis and Discussion}
\subsection{Comparing the Final Paradigms}
Our research journey produced two high-performance but fundamentally different technological paths, compared in Table \ref{tab:final_comp}. While the photonic BTO approach offers phenomenal theoretical efficiency, this is achieved at the cost of extreme manufacturing complexity. The acoustic approach delivers comparable performance using a technology that is orders of magnitude simpler, cheaper, and more scalable.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Final comparison of the optimized photonic and acoustic platforms.}
\label{tab:final_comp}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Photonics (BTO)} & \textbf{Acoustics (SAW)} \\
\midrule
Sim. Efficiency & V$\pi$L = 0.045 V·cm & L$_c$ = 5.0 mm \\
Performance & Excellent & Excellent \\
Manufacturing & Very Complex & \textbf{Simple / CMOS} \\
Cost/Scalability & Low & \textbf{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion of Limitations}
The primary limitation of this work is that all evidence is computational. The simulations use idealized material parameters and do not account for fabrication imperfections or material absorption losses. The SAW simulation is a proxy, calculating an optical effect rather than the full multi-physics interaction. The "error analysis" in this paper is therefore a chronicle of the errors in our initial hypotheses. The initial bias towards a purely photonic solution was corrected only by confronting the evidence and its practical implications.

\subsection{Conclusion: A Proposed Paradigm Shift}
This work began as an optimization study and ended as a proposal for a paradigm shift. The computational evidence strongly suggests that while photonic platforms like Si$_3$N$_4$+BTO can be pushed to extraordinary performance levels, they may be a technologically and economically inferior path for scalable RTQC control. The final synthesis is a clear recommendation: the most promising route lies in leveraging simpler, high-coupling, CMOS-compatible mechanisms. Future research should prioritize the experimental demonstration of qubit control via Surface Acoustic Waves on SiC substrates.

\section*{Agents4Science AI Involvement Checklist}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis development}: Hypothesis development includes the process by which you came to explore this research topic and research question.

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The human researcher defined the initial problem (scalable RTQC control). The AI, prompted with this problem, proposed the iterative structure of the investigation. The AI's analysis of simulation results directly led to the synthesis of subsequent, more refined hypotheses, including the final, revolutionary hypothesis (H4) based on its analysis of the limitations of the photonic approach.
    \item \textbf{Experimental design and implementation}: This category includes design of experiments that are used to test the hypotheses, coding and implementation of computational methods, and the execution of these experiments.

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The human provided the high-level physical models and constraints. The AI was solely responsible for writing, debugging, and executing all Python simulation code using the EMpy library. The iterative debugging process was a critical part of the implementation. The human executed the final scripts.
    \item \textbf{Analysis of data and interpretation of results}: This category encompasses any process to organize and process data for the experiments in the paper. It also includes interpretations of the results of the study.

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The AI performed all primary data analysis, calculating derived metrics (V$\pi$L, Lc) and generating plots. The interpretation of the results was collaborative: the AI provided a first-pass analysis, which the human then contextualized within the broader scientific narrative, leading to the key synthesis steps.
    \item \textbf{Writing}: This includes any processes for compiling results, methods, etc. into the final paper form.

    Answer: \involvementD{}

    Explanation: The AI was responsible for generating 100\% of the LaTeX code and the manuscript text, based on high-level prompts from the human researcher to structure the paper around the chronicle of the research cycle. This included writing all sections and checklist text. The human's role was to provide the prompts and review the final output.

    \item \textbf{Observed AI Limitations}: What limitations have you found when using AI as a partner or lead author?

    Description: The most significant limitation was the AI's initial inability to correctly interface with the specific API of the `EMpy` library. It repeatedly made incorrect assumptions about constructor arguments, leading to a frustrating but ultimately educational cycle of `TypeError` exceptions. This demonstrates a weakness in reasoning about unfamiliar, sparsely documented codebases. The issue was only resolved through a meticulous process of human-led falsification, where the human provided the exact error messages, forcing the AI to systematically correct its own flawed hypotheses about the code.
