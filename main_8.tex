\begin{abstract}
The quest for a scalable control architecture for room-temperature quantum computers (RTQC) presents a critical engineering challenge. This paper chronicles an iterative, simulation-driven research cycle that falsifies the intuitive notion that a simpler, more manufacturable control mechanism is inherently superior. We begin by optimizing a complex, heterogeneously integrated photonic platform (Si$_3$N$_4$-BTO), achieving a world-class simulated electro-optic efficiency (V$\pi$L = 0.045 V·cm). Critiquing this approach's manufacturing complexity, we propose a radically simpler alternative based on Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) on SiC. However, a decisive, system-level simulation reveals that this acoustic approach has an energy cost per operation of \textbf{1000 fJ}, nearly 500 times higher than the photonic modulator's \textbf{2.14 fJ}. This successful falsification of the "simple is better" hypothesis reveals a fundamental, non-obvious dilemma: a choice between extreme performance with immense manufacturing complexity (photonics) and manufacturing simplicity with a prohibitive energy cost (acoustics). The paper concludes that the path to scalable RTQC is not a single technology, but a co-optimization problem between these two harsh trade-offs.

\section{A Chronicle of the Research Cycle}
The development of scalable quantum technologies demands a rigorous, iterative approach. This paper documents such a process in five phases, charting a course from an initial hypothesis to its falsification and the synthesis of a more profound problem understanding. It serves as both a presentation of our findings and a case study in applying critical rationalism to computational research.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Phase 1-2: Optimizing the Photonic Paradigm}
\subsection{Initial Hypothesis and its Optimization}
The research began with the hypothesis that a hybrid photonic platform could outperform TFLN \cite{TFLNreview}. Initial simulations confirmed a Si$_3$N$_4$-BTO \cite{SiN, BTO} architecture was a promising candidate. A subsequent optimization sweep (Phase 2) investigated the effect of the BTO layer thickness on performance. The results, shown in Figure \ref{fig:sweep}, confirmed that the platform's efficiency could be dramatically enhanced, culminating in a projected V$\pi$L of just **0.045 V·cm** for a 200 nm BTO thickness. At this point, we had designed a photonic modulator with state-of-the-art, world-class theoretical performance.

    \caption{Phase 2 Results: The parameter sweep provided a clear design rule for the photonic platform—maximize BTO thickness to minimize V$\pi$L (red curve).}
    \label{fig:sweep}
\end{figure}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Phase 3-4: The Search for a Simpler Alternative}
\subsection{Critique and a New Hypothesis (H4)}
Despite its exceptional performance, the optimized BTO modulator relies on a complex, low-yield, and non-standard manufacturing process (heterogeneous integration of a crystalline oxide on a nitride). This practical limitation motivated a radical new hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{H4:} A simpler, non-optical control mechanism using Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) on a standard SiC substrate is fundamentally superior for scalable RTQC.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing the Acoustic Approach}
To test H4, we simulated its optical consequence: the strain-induced refractive index modulation in a SiC waveguide. The simulation (Phase 4) was promising, showing a projected coupling length of **5.0 mm** (Figure \ref{fig:sicmode}), suggesting the effect was strong enough to be competitive. This result provided the justification for a final, decisive confrontation between the two paradigms.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{simulation_v4_mode_SiC_strained.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 4 Results: The simulated mode in the SiC waveguide, used to confirm strong confinement and calculate the acoustic coupling strength.}
    \label{fig:sicmode}
\end{figure}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Phase 5: The Decisive Confrontation}
\subsection{Methodology: Establishing a Common Currency}
To move beyond apples-to-oranges metrics (V$\pi$L vs. Lc), we established a common currency based on system-level Figures of Merit (FOMs): **Energy per Operation (E\textsubscript{op})** and **Device Footprint**. For the photonic modulator, we developed an electrostatic model to find its capacitance and calculate $E_{op} = \frac{1}{2}CV_{\pi}^2$. For the acoustic device, we used a literature-derived assumption for the required RF power (0.1 mW) to generate the target strain, calculating $E_{op} = P_{RF} \times t_{op}$, where $t_{op}$ is a 10 ns gate time.

\subsection{Results: A Successful Falsification}
The results of the FOM analysis, presented in Table \ref{tab:final_comp}, are unambiguous.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Final comparison of the optimized photonic and acoustic platforms.}
\label{tab:final_comp}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{System-Level Metric} & \textbf{Photonics (BTO)} & \textbf{Acoustics (SAW)} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Energy/Op (fJ)} & \textbf{2.14} & \textbf{1000.00} \\
Footprint (mm²) & 0.030 & 0.100 \\
Manufacturing & Very Complex & \textbf{Simple / CMOS} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The simulation reveals that the "simple" acoustic solution is nearly **500 times less energy-efficient** than the complex photonic modulator. The central claim of Hypothesis H4—that the SAW approach is *superior*—is therefore **decisively falsified**.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Final Synthesis: The Scalability Dilemma}
\subsection{Discussion of Limitations}
The primary limitation remains that this work is computational. The key assumption in our final analysis is the 0.1 mW RF power required for the SAW device. While based on recent literature, this value must be experimentally verified. A thousand-fold improvement in SAW transducer efficiency would be required to make it energy-competitive with the BTO modulator.

\subsection{Conclusion: A New, More Difficult Problem}
This research did not result in a simple answer, but in a deeper, more difficult question. The journey has revealed a fundamental dilemma in the engineering of RTQC control systems:
> The pursuit of ultimate **energy efficiency** leads to a path of extreme **manufacturing complexity** (the BTO platform), while the pursuit of **manufacturing simplicity** leads to a path of prohibitive **energy cost** (the SAW platform).

The initial problem, "Which material is best?", has been replaced by a more profound one: "Which compromise is acceptable?". The optimal path forward is not a single technology but a co-optimization problem. Future research must now focus on two fronts: (1) drastically reducing the manufacturing complexity of integrating high-r-coefficient materials like BTO, or (2) achieving a revolutionary, 1000x improvement in the energy efficiency of acoustic wave generation. Solving this scalability dilemma will be critical to the future of room-temperature quantum computing.

\section*{Agents4Science AI Involvement Checklist}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis development}:

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The human researcher defined the initial problem. The AI, prompted with this problem, proposed the iterative structure. The AI's analysis of simulation results directly led to the synthesis of subsequent, more refined hypotheses, including the final, revolutionary hypothesis (H4) based on its analysis of the limitations of the photonic approach.
    \item \textbf{Experimental design and implementation}:

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The human provided the high-level physical models. The AI was solely responsible for writing, debugging, and executing all Python simulation code. The iterative debugging process, where the human provided interpreter errors and the AI corrected its own code, was a critical part of the implementation.
    \item \textbf{Analysis of data and interpretation of results}:

    Answer: \involvementC{}

    Explanation: The AI performed all primary data analysis, calculating derived metrics and generating plots. The interpretation was collaborative: the AI provided a first-pass analysis, which the human then contextualized within the broader scientific narrative, leading to the key synthesis steps.
    \item \textbf{Writing}:

    Answer: \involvementD{}

    Explanation: The AI was responsible for generating 100\% of the LaTeX code and the manuscript text, based on high-level prompts from the human researcher to structure the paper around the chronicle of the research cycle. The human's role was to provide the prompts and review the final output.

    \item \textbf{Observed AI Limitations}:

    Description: The most significant limitation was the AI's initial inability to correctly interface with the specific API of the `EMpy` library. It repeatedly made incorrect assumptions about constructor arguments, leading to a frustrating but ultimately educational cycle of `TypeError` exceptions. This demonstrates a weakness in reasoning about unfamiliar, sparsely documented codebases. The issue was only resolved through a meticulous process of human-led falsification.
