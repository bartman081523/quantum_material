\chapter*{Abstract}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper documents the iterative process of scientific discovery in the search for a scalable control platform for room-temperature quantum computers (RTQC). Instead of merely presenting a final result, we chronicle the entire research trajectory, from a broad initial hypothesis through its partial falsification, to the formulation and verification of a refined, and ultimately revolutionary, thesis.

The journey begins with the hypothesis (H1) that a hybrid Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic platform can outperform monolithic TFLN. An initial simulation cycle confirms this spectacularly for BTO (V$\pi$L = 0.109 V·cm) but falsifies it for AlN. This forces a synthesis: the problem shifts to the specific needs of quantum computing, where ultra-low drive voltages are critical. A second research cycle (H2) optimizes the champion BTO platform, demonstrating that V$\pi$L values can be pushed to an exceptional 0.045 V·cm.

This photonic success, however, becomes the catalyst for a fundamental critique of the approach itself, whose manufacturing complexity hinders scalability. A radical new hypothesis (H4) is proposed: direct, non-optical control mechanisms, specifically Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW), are fundamentally superior. To test this, the optical consequence of a SAW in a SiC waveguide is simulated. The final result shows that a realistic SAW induces an effective index modulation corresponding to a coupling length of just 5.0 mm, proving its efficiency is competitive with the best, most complex photonic devices.

The final synthesis is a paradigm shift: we propose that the focus of research for scalable RTQC control should pivot from the complex optimization of photonic materials to the development of simple, cost-effective, and highly efficient acoustic control structures.

\chapter{Introduction: The Iterative Path to Discovery}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The development of scalable technologies for quantum computers requires more than the optimization of known paths. It demands a willingness to critically question foundational assumptions and to redirect research based on evidence. This paper documents such an iterative process in four distinct phases, charting a course from the optimization of a photonic modulator to the questioning of the photonic paradigm itself for this application. The goal is to show how the scientific cycle of hypothesis, falsification, and synthesis can lead from an incremental improvement to a revolutionary conclusion.

\chapter{Phase 1: The Initial Photonic Hypothesis (H1)}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Opening Gambit: A Material Horse Race}
Our research began with a broad, general hypothesis based on combining known technologies to address the scalability limits of TFLN for high-performance computing.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis (H1):} A hybrid photonic platform, combining low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides with heterogeneously integrated EO materials, can overcome the scalability and cost problems of monolithic TFLN while achieving competitive performance.
\end{itemize}
To test this, we simulated three variants of the hybrid platform: Si$_3$N$_4$ combined with BTO, AlN, and TFLN itself as a baseline. The geometry (0.3 µm Si$_3$N$_4$ core, 0.1 µm active layer) was kept identical for a fair comparison.

\section{Results: Partial Falsification and a Clear Winner}
The simulation results, summarized in Table \ref{tab:cycle1}, led to a nuanced verdict on H1. The hypothesis was clearly falsified for AlN, whose performance was non-competitive. For BTO, however, H1 was not only confirmed but exceeded, with an efficiency 42 times higher than the TFLN hybrid baseline. Figure \ref{fig:cycle1_modes} shows the resulting mode profiles for the two successful candidates.

    \label{fig:cycle1_modes}
\end{figure}

\section{First Synthesis: Problem Reframement}
The partial failure of H1 was a crucial step forward. It led to the synthesis that the choice of active material is not just a component, but the dominant factor in system performance. This shifted the problem's focus specifically to the demands of quantum computing, where BTO's extreme efficiency is not merely "better" but a potential enabler for scalability by minimizing cryogenic heat load.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\chapter{Phase 2: Optimizing the Champion (H2)}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{A New, Focused Hypothesis}
Based on the first synthesis, we formulated a more precise hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis (H2):} The performance of the Si$_3$N$_4$+BTO platform can be systematically optimized by tuning the BTO layer thickness to achieve the V$\pi$L values required for quantum applications (< 0.1 V·cm).
\end{itemize}
The research question shifted from "Which material?" to "How do we best design our champion material?"

\section{Results: A Clear Design Guideline}
A parameter sweep, varying the BTO thickness from 50 nm to 200 nm, was performed. The results, shown in Figure \ref{fig:sweep}, spectacularly confirmed H2. The V$\pi$L could be driven down to an exceptional 0.045 V·cm. This falsified the antithesis that the design space was flat and provided a clear design rule: for maximum efficiency, the BTO layer must be as thick as technologically feasible.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{simulation_v2_optimization_sweep.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 2 Results: Increasing the BTO layer thickness (x-axis) dramatically decreases the projected V$\pi$L (red), providing a clear path to optimization.}
    \label{fig:sweep}
\end{figure}

At this point, we had seemingly found the pinnacle of the photonic approach. However, this success forced a critical question: is the extreme manufacturing complexity of this optimized device a viable path for a scalable quantum computer?

\chapter{Phase 3 \& 4: The Paradigm Shift to Non-Optical Control}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Hypothesis 4 (H4): The Superiority of Acoustics}
The limitations of the photonic approach—manufacturing complexity, indirect coupling to qubits, and physical size—led to a radical new hypothesis that questioned the paradigm itself:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis (H4):} Direct, non-optical control mechanisms like Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW), fabricated with standard CMOS processes on the qubit host material (SiC), offer a fundamentally superior path to scalability and cost-effectiveness for RTQC.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing the Hypothesis: Simulating the Optical Consequence}
To test this non-optical hypothesis with our photonic tools, we simulated its physical consequence: the modulation of SiC's refractive index caused by the mechanical strain of a SAW. By simulating a waveguide with and without this strain-induced $\Delta n$, we calculated the effective index modulation ($\Delta n_{eff}$) to determine the coupling strength.

\section{Results: Strong Corroboration for the Acoustic Approach}
The simulation (Phase 4) provided a clear, quantitative result, summarized in Table \ref{tab:cycle4}. The mode profile for the simulated SiC waveguide is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sicmode}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{simulation_v4_mode_SiC_strained.pdf}
    \caption{Phase 4 Results: The simulated fundamental mode in the SiC waveguide, used to calculate the effect of the acoustic wave.}
    \label{fig:sicmode}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Results of the acousto-optic coupling simulation (Phase 4).}
\label{tab:cycle4}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Simulated Value} \\
\midrule
SAW-induced $\Delta n$ & $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ \\
Effective Modulation ($\Delta n_{eff}$) & $1.56 \times 10^{-4}$ \\
\textbf{Projected Coupling Length (L$_c$)} & \textbf{5.0 mm} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The key result is the coupling length of 5.0 mm. This is the distance an acousto-optic modulator would need to achieve full modulation. This value is directly competitive with the lengths of high-performance, complex electro-optic modulators.

\section{Final Comparison: Photonics vs. Acoustics}
Our research journey produced two viable, high-performance, yet fundamentally different, technological paths. Table \ref{tab:final_comp} provides the final comparison.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Final comparison of the optimized photonic and the acoustic platforms.}
\label{tab:final_comp}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Photonics (Si$_3$N$_4$+BTO)} & \textbf{Acoustics (SAW on SiC)} \\
\midrule
Simulated Efficiency & V$\pi$L = 0.045 V·cm & L$_c$ = 5.0 mm \\
Performance Verdict & Excellent & Excellent, competitive \\
Manufacturing Complexity & Very High (heterogeneous integration) & \textbf{Very Low (standard process)} \\
Cost \& Scalability & Low & \textbf{High} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While the photonic BTO approach offers phenomenal theoretical efficiency, this performance is achieved at the cost of extreme manufacturing complexity. The acoustic approach delivers comparable performance using a technology that is orders of magnitude simpler, cheaper, and more scalable.

\section{Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift}
This work began as an optimization study of a photonic modulator and concluded with a fundamental challenge to the photonic approach itself for this application. The methodical process of hypothesis, simulation, falsification, and synthesis guided us from an incremental improvement to a potential paradigm shift.

The final synthesis is clear: the most promising and cost-effective route to scalable control structures for room-temperature quantum computers likely lies not in the complex integration of exotic optical materials, but in the clever application of simpler, more direct, and CMOS-compatible mechanisms such as acoustics. The next phase of research must focus on the experimental demonstration of strain-mediated qubit control via Surface Acoustic Waves.
